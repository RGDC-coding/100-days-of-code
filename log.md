**Today's Progress**: Started learning about HTML forms.

**Thoughts:**

Today, I began learning about HTML forms. With a foundational understanding of HTML and CSS, I attempted to complete the first project on freeCodeCamp. However, I realized that my knowledge of HTML forms was insufficient. Consequently, I started the "Learn HTML Forms by Building a Registration Form" course and coded along until step 22.
