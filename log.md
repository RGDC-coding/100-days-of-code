## Log

### R1D1 Jul 30, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Started learning about HTML forms.

**Thoughts:**

Today, I began learning about HTML forms. With a foundational understanding of HTML and CSS, I attempted to complete the first project on freeCodeCamp. However, I realized that my knowledge of HTML forms was insufficient. Consequently, I started the "Learn HTML Forms by Building a Registration Form" course and coded along until step 22.

### R1D2 Jul 31, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Finished the "Learn HTML Forms by Building a Registration Form" course and completed the "Survey Form" certification project.

**Thoughts:** I dedicated about 4-6 hours to coding today. Completing the HTML forms course provided the foundation I needed, and applying this knowledge to the Survey Form project was highly rewarding.
