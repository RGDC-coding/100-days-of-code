## Log

### R1D1 Jul 30, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Started learning about HTML forms.

**Thoughts:**

Today, I began learning about HTML forms. With a foundational understanding of HTML and CSS, I attempted to complete the first project on freeCodeCamp. However, I realized that my knowledge of HTML forms was insufficient. Consequently, I started the "Learn HTML Forms by Building a Registration Form" course and coded along until step 22.

### R1D2 Jul 31, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Finished the "Learn HTML Forms by Building a Registration Form" course and completed the "Survey Form" certification project.

**Thoughts:** I dedicated about 4-6 hours to coding today. Completing the HTML forms course provided the foundation I needed, and applying this knowledge to the Survey Form project was highly rewarding.

### R1D2 Ago 01, 2024

**Today's Progress:**

 Finished several freeCodeCamp courses: "Learn the CSS Box Model by Building a Rothko Painting," "Learn CSS Flexbox by Building a Photo Gallery," "Learn Typography by Building a Nutrition Label," and "Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz."

 Found and fixed a bug in the "Survey Form" project where the languages list overflowed out of the form box due to font formatting. The bug was resolved by adding font formatting to all elements (*).

 Started the "Tribute Page" freeCodeCamp certification project and coded an HTML draft with all required user stories, using placeholder images and lorem ipsum for text.

**Thoughts:**
It was a challenging day due to only getting 4 hours of sleep, as my wife's goddaughter went to the hospital. Despite the fatigue, I managed to be productive and make significant progress.
